# Revision Control

## What is Revision Control?

Revision control in Reaction adds the ability for admin users to review, stage, and revert changes to products. When enabled any changes to a product will be saved as a draft, with the original product remaining unchanged. Upon publishing changes to that draft, the publicly visibly product will then have those changes applied.

At the moment revision control is merely used to stage a single upcoming update.

## Making changes to a product

Make changes to the product as you would normally.

In the following example, we update the title of the product from `Basic Reaction Product` to `Reaction Product`. Notice now that `Publish Changes` button is now lit up green. This indicates that there are changes to publish.

Clicking the publish changes button will make all the changes made to the product visible to customers.

## Enable / Disable Revision Control

In the dashboard under `Catalog`, you may turn revision control `on`, or `off`.

Currently, turning off revision will give you the legacy version of the product detail page.
